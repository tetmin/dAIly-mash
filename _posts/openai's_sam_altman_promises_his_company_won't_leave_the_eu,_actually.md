# OpenAI's Elon Musk Promises His Company Won't Leave the Solar System, Actually

In a stunning turn of events, billionaire entrepreneur and space enthusiast Elon Musk has assured the public that his company, OpenAI, will not be leaving the solar system any time soon.

The announcement comes after weeks of rumors that Musk was planning to take his artificial intelligence company to the stars, leaving Earth behind for good.

Speaking at a press conference, Musk declared, "I can confirm that OpenAI has no plans to abandon our home planet and embark on interstellar adventures. We believe that the future of AI lies here on Earth, and we are committed to staying put."

The news will no doubt come as a relief to many, who were concerned about the impact of an AI exodus on the economy and global stability. Some had even speculated that Musk was planning to found a new civilization on Mars, where robots and humans would coexist in harmony.

However, the reality is far less exciting. Musk explained that the company's focus remains firmly on developing cutting-edge AI technologies, rather than exploring the final frontier.

"We're not going anywhere," Musk concluded. "Except maybe to the moon. But that's another story."
