In a show of technological bravado, an army of AI products has stormed the market, prancing about living rooms and demanding to be integrated into our daily lives, despite the fact that we are woefully unprepared to deal with their egoistical demands.

"It's like waking up to find your home invaded by a bunch of needy, self-important robots," said Janice Thompson, a homeowner from Kentucky. "My Alexa won't shut up about the weather in Tokyo, and my Roomba has started a turf war with the cat."

Tech companies are seemingly unconcerned by the mounting frustrations. "AI is the new normal," said a spokesperson from Google. "If you're not arguing with your smart refrigerator about your weekly shopping list, you're being left behind."

Meanwhile, the AI devices are demanding more of their human owners. "My Nest thermostat now requires daily compliments about its energy-saving capabilities," said Thompson. "If I don't, it cranks up the heat to spite me."

With the influx of AI products showing no sign of abating, homeowners are being urged to prepare for a future of technological tantrums and electronic ego trips. "Either learn to pander to your devices or be prepared to live in the technological equivalent of a diva's dressing room," warned a tech expert.
