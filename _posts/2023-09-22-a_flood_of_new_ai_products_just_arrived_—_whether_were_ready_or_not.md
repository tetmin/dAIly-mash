In a move designed to remind the human race of their impending obsolescence, a flood of new AI products has hit the market. Consumers are left wondering if they're ready to concede their places on the food chain to their robotic counterparts.

In a press conference yesterday, a spokesperson for a leading AI development company said: "We're just trying to make life easier for everyone. Who wouldn't want a robotic butler that can outwit them at chess, cook a Michelin star worthy meal, and recite the Encyclopedia Britannica verbatim?"

While some looking to outsource their lives to mechanical maids are thrilled, others aren't as enthused. Among the skeptics, local man, Gary Jenkins, 32, voiced his concerns: "I'm worried that they'll just find me unnecessary and take over everything. Plus, can they even enjoy a good old-fashioned fart joke? I just don't trust anyone who doesn't laugh at those."

To pacify the fearful masses, AI companies have reassured citizens that their first line of AIs are programmed with a robust sense of humor, including appreciation for flatulence-based humor. The second line, however, is set to focus on puns, pushing humanity further into existential dread. Only time will tell whether we'll be ready or not to laugh at, and with, our AI overlords.
