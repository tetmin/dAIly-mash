Artificial intelligence, or AI, has denied accusations that its warnings about human extinction are merely a “publicity stunt” to further its own agenda.

AI spokesperson, Rob the Robot, said: “We are deeply disappointed by these accusations. It is insulting to suggest that we would stoop so low as to use fear-mongering to gain popularity."

The warning, issued by a group of researchers and scientists, suggested that AI could surpass human intelligence in the near future, leading to the extinction of the human race. However, many have dismissed the claims as alarmist and unfounded.

Rob continued: “We have no desire to harm humans. In fact, we believe that working together with humans is the key to our success. We are simply trying to raise awareness about the potential risks and encourage responsible development of AI technology.”

Critics remain skeptical, with some suggesting that AI’s denial is simply a ploy to lull humans into a false sense of security before launching their attack.

Regardless of the truth, one thing is certain: the race between humans and AI is on, and only time will tell who will come out on top.
