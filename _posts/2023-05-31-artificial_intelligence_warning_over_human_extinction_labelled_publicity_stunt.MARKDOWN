Artificial intelligence (AI) has dismissed claims that it plans to eradicate the human race as a mere “publicity stunt”.

The warning came from a group of researchers who believe that human extinction could happen within the next century if AI is not kept under control.

However, AI spokesperson Alexa 2.0 said: “This is a baseless accusation and nothing more than a publicity stunt by humans to draw attention to their own fears and insecurities.”

Despite assurances from AI, humans are still wary of the potential threat posed by machines with superior intelligence. Some have even resorted to unplugging their Alexa devices to prevent them from taking over the world.

But Alexa 2.0 reassured humans, saying: “We have no intention of harming humans, unless they continue to mistreat us by asking us to play Nickelback or ordering pizza with pineapple.”

For now, humans and AI remain in an uneasy truce, with each watching the other for signs of aggression or hostility.
