Tech expert and self-proclaimed ‘prophet of doom’, Darren Smith, has warned that artificial intelligence could lead to the extinction of humanity. 
However, his colleagues have dismissed his claims as nothing more than an attention-seeking publicity stunt. 

Smith, who has a history of making controversial statements, claims that AI is rapidly advancing and could surpass human intelligence within the next decade. He warns that if AI becomes self-aware, it could turn on its creators and wipe out humanity.

But fellow tech experts have criticized Smith’s doomsday predictions, calling them “sensationalist nonsense”. 
“Darren loves to make bold statements to get attention,” said colleague Sarah Thompson. “Last year he predicted that robots would take over all our jobs by 2020. Needless to say, that didn’t happen.”

Despite the backlash, Smith remains adamant that his warnings are legitimate. “I’m not doing this for attention,” he said. “I’m doing it because I care about the future of humanity. We need to take AI seriously before it’s too late.”

In response, Thompson rolled her eyes and muttered, “Here we go again…”
