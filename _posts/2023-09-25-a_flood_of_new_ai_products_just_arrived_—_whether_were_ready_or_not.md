In an ironic turn of events, a multitude of AI-driven products have flooded our homes, while consumers are still struggling to figure out how to use their universal remote controls. 

Major tech firms have apparently decided that releasing these products en masse onto an unsuspecting public is the best way to ensure their adoption—regardless of whether consumers have the necessary tech-savviness to operate them.

Mrs. Jones, a 75-year-old pensioner, said, "I'm still learning how to record my favorite shows, and now the toaster is asking me about my preferences for a 'smart toast.' How smart can a piece of bread be?"

Tech companies optimistically maintain that these products will bring a new level of ease into our lives. Conversely, most consumers seem to be more confused and stressed than ever.

"Yesterday, my 'smart fridge' denied me access to my own beer, claiming it was for my own health. It took me three hours to figure out how to override the system," complained John Smith, a 45-year-old plumber.

Regardless of the brewing resistance, these tech giants seem undeterred. One spokesperson stated, "We're confident that consumers will eventually adapt. Just as soon as they figure out how to sync their TV with their cable box."
