In a groundbreaking announcement, AI experts claim that artificial intelligence has the power to revolutionize the world and solve all of humanity's problems. From curing diseases to stabilizing the climate and even putting an end to poverty, the possibilities seem endless.

However, before we get too carried away with these grandiose claims, let's not overlook a crucial detail: can AI make a decent cup of tea?

It's all well and good to talk about curing diseases and saving the planet, but if our AI overlords can't even brew a proper cuppa, then what's the point?

Dr. Barry Brewster, a leading AI researcher, said: "Sure, AI has the potential to do amazing things. But let's not forget the basics. We need to prioritize teaching these machines the art of a good brew. After all, what's the point of solving climate change if we can't sit back and enjoy a nice cup of tea while doing it?"

While the promise of AI improving the world is exciting, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's make sure our AI companions can at least make a proper cup of tea before we start relying on them to save humanity.
