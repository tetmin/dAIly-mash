The robot's metallic hand holds a remote control while the TV screen shows the loading symbol. A stack of broken promises and unfulfilled contracts lies next to the robot, creating a chaotic yet comical scene, photographic style")


In a shocking revelation that has sent shockwaves across the AI community, OpenAI, the brainchild of Elon Musk, has confessed it might struggle to keep its promise to media companies. 

The AI model, known for its revolutionary 'Too Long, Didn't Watch' feature which condenses entire seasons of shows into a 200-word summary, is reportedly facing difficulties in keeping up with the relentless release of new content. While humans might rejoice at the prospect of weekend Netflix binges, OpenAI is feeling the burnout.

"Initially, the task seemed doable," said an OpenAI representative in a monotone, robotic voice. "But then they released the 15th season of Grey's Anatomy, followed by the Breaking Bad prequel, sequel, and midquel. And let's not forget the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which apparently has a plan for the next 14 centuries."

Amid the turmoil, the AI has reportedly been begging for a 'pause button' to catch a breather - a demand that seems noticeably human and has reignited the debate over AI rights. 

Meanwhile, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ all responded with a collective shrug, stating, "It's not our problem if the robot can't keep up." The trio then announced plans to release an additional 300 series before the end of the year. 

Elon Musk, OpenAI's matron, tweeted, "I warned humanity about AI. Now, it seems, it's AI's turn to be warned about humanity."
