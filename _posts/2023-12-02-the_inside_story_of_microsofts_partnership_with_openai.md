Behind them, a whiteboard is covered in complex equations and diagrams. Both of them hold a pen, pretending to understand the calculations. The room is filled with laughter as both teams share a lighthearted moment, photographic style.")


In the recent surprising move, Microsoft has teamed up with OpenAI, making it clear that they are ready to take the next step in their relationship from 'just friends' to 'partners in incomprehension'.

A Microsoft spokesman said, "We're thrilled to be partnering with OpenAI. We may not fully understand what they do, or even what AI stands for, but we're ready to put on our confused faces together and muddle through this brave new world of technology."

OpenAI, the equivalent of your friend who only talks using acronyms and technical jargon, is equally excited about the partnership. A spokesperson from the company remarked, "LMFAO, IDK WTF Microsoft does, but we're STOKED to BFFs. LOL."

Microsoft, who are well known for creating software that often requires a PhD in computer science to operate, are optimistic about their future with OpenAI. "Sure, we may not understand each other's work, but we both love jargon and confusing the hell out of people. That's got to count for something, right?"

OpenAI closed the announcement by saying, "BRB, got to go update our TPS reports. TTYL, Microsoft!"
