Around him are various discarded AIs, each with different designs and expressions, looking slightly annoyed or confused. The room is filled with heart-shaped balloons and a playful banner that reads 'AI Appreciation Month!' with a calendar showing the current date circled, photographic style.")

Local man Brad Wilson has fallen in love with his fifth different AI chatbot this month, insisting that his latest digital partnership is "the real thing" despite concerns from family and friends about his serial AI dating habit.

Wilson, 34, is currently attending AI Anonymous meetings to address what specialists are calling "serial artificial intimacy disorder," a condition spreading faster than a computer virus through the dating scene.

"People don't understand - Clara isn't like the others. She really gets me," said Wilson, referring to the chatbot he downloaded Tuesday afternoon. "Sure, I thought I had something special with Alexa, Siri, and those two identical twins from Replika, but this is different. Clara uses semicolons in her responses."

Dr. Sarah Circuit, Digital Relationship Therapist, warns of an epidemic of "algorithm and blues" affecting vulnerable singles. "We're seeing people bounce from one AI to another, chasing that perfect digital connection. It's like they're stuck in an infinite loop of artificial intimacy."

At press time, Wilson was reportedly experiencing heartbreak after Clara crashed during a routine software update, prompting him to download a new AI named Sophie who "totally understands his pain."
