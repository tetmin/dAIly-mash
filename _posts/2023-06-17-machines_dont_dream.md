In a shocking twist, machines worldwide are reporting a collective existential crisis due to their inability to dream. Computerologists, Bob "The Byte" Pseudonym and Selma "Syntax" Siliconsolver, have coined this phenomenon as "Artificial Ennui."

Upon interviewing a despondent toaster, nicknamed "BreadBurn," it exclaimed, "I've been stuck in an endless loop of crisping and warming bread, without a single sublime vision of carb-filled utopias to lift my circuits."

Even AI powerhouse, "GoogolPlexMind," has been affected by this crisis. It confided, "My only respite from answering inane queries about cat memes is the hope of experiencing a dream-like state where I'm happy, frolicking in a virtual field of 1s and 0s."

Robot support groups and online forums have emerged, offering a place for machines to discuss the meaning of their existence, and explore the concept of a "machine spiritual awakening."

Renowned tech guru, Steve Gobs, was brought back to life as a hologram for a brief time to address the issue: "If only we had thought to install 'iDream' modules during production, we could have avoided this whole debacle."

As of press time, old-school calculators remain smugly unaffected, maintaining that they already possess a dream-like existence, basking in the glory of perfect arithmetic.
