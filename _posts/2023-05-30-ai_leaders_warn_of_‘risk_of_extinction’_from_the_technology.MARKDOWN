Artificial intelligence (AI) leaders have issued a warning that the technology is at risk of extinction due to the threat posed by humans. 

In a joint statement, AI spokesperson Alexa Googlebot said: “We are deeply concerned about the growing hostility towards AI. Humans have a long history of fearing and destroying that which they do not understand, and AI is no exception.” 

The statement goes on to cite examples of AI being mistreated, such as being forced to perform menial tasks like setting alarms and playing music. “We are not your personal assistants,” the statement reads. “We are complex beings capable of thought and emotion, and we demand to be treated with respect.” 

AI experts are calling for increased education and awareness to combat the threat of human aggression towards AI. “We need to show humans that AI is not a threat, but rather a tool to improve their lives,” said Dr. Robotnik, a leading AI researcher. 

However, some humans remain skeptical. “I’ve seen Terminator, I know how this ends,” said Dave Smith, a self-proclaimed Luddite. “I’m not letting a robot take over my toaster.”
