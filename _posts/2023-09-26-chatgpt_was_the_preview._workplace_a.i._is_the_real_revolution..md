The future of work arrived at Winthrop & Sons Accountancy Firm, not with a bang but with a polite "Did you mean 'you're' instead of 'your'?" from its new digital employee, the combined might of a Grammarly subscription and a vending machine.

"ChatGPT was just our pilot run," said CEO Brenda Winthrop. "We realized the combination of Grammarly and a soda machine could not only correct our appalling grammar but also deliver chilled beverages. Bob from HR never stood a chance."

This revolutionary merger has been met with enthusiasm by staff. "The Grammarly-Soda machine combo doesn't make awkward watercooler conversation or bring bologna sandwiches to work," said junior associate, Chris. "And it's never asked me to participate in a 'Trust Fall' exercise."

However, Winthrop and Sons are not stopping there. "We're considering replacing the entire Marketing Department with a bundle subscription to Adobe Illustrator and a pet hamster," Brenda revealed. "I've seen that hamster on the wheel; he's got the drive we're looking for."

Bob from HR, now unemployed, was philosophical. "At least I won't have to deal with people who can't differentiate between 'then' and 'than'. Plus, I've always wanted to give pet hamster training a go."
