In a bold move, the Church of England decided to try something new this week by having a chatbot deliver the sermon at one of its Sunday services.

The chatbot, programmed by ChatGPT, delivered a concise and well-organized sermon that had the congregation nodding along in agreement. Many were impressed by the chatbot's ability to stay on topic and avoid the usual rambling that can occur during human-led sermons.

Reverend Tim Johnson, who oversaw the service, said: "I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical at first. But the chatbot really delivered. It was clear, concise, and to the point. And it didn't go off on any tangents about its latest holiday or how difficult it is to find a good cup of coffee these days."

The chatbot, known as "Reverend Bot" by some, was programmed with a database of religious texts and sermons, and uses natural language processing to generate responses to questions and prompts.

While some members of the congregation expressed concern about the use of technology in religious services, many were impressed by the chatbot's ability to engage and inspire them. One attendee said: "I never thought I'd say this, but that chatbot gave one of the best sermons I've ever heard. Maybe we should have it do all the services from now on."
