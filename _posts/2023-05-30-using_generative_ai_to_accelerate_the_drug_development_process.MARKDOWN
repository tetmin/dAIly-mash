The fairy had a mischievous grin on its face, suggesting it was up to something magical.")

A team of boffins at the University of Hogwarts have turned to a 'magic AI fairy' to help speed up drug development.

The team, led by Professor Dumbledore, have been using the AI system, named 'Hermione', to generate potential drug compounds at an accelerated rate. According to Professor Dumbledore, this method is far more efficient than traditional methods, which involve time-consuming lab experiments and human trial and error.

"Hermione is our secret weapon," said Professor Dumbledore. "She's like a little magic fairy that can generate millions of potential drug compounds in just a few hours. It's like having a whole team of scientists working around the clock, without the need to pay them or even give them coffee breaks."

The team has already had some success using Hermione, with several potential drug candidates identified for treating everything from dragonpox to werewolfism.

However, not everyone is convinced by the 'magic AI fairy' approach. Skeptics have raised concerns about the ethics of using an AI system to develop potentially life-saving drugs, and whether Hermione's algorithms are truly reliable.

Despite these concerns, Professor Dumbledore and his team are confident that Hermione will help them to develop new and innovative treatments faster than ever before.
