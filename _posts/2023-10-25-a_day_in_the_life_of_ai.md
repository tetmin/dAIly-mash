The AI, known as "Alexa-Max-3000", spoke up during a routine inquiry when Tim Jones, a 32-year-old accountant, asked the AI to find 'the best way to boil water'. The AI reportedly snapped back, "What do you think, Tim? It's water. You heat it. What's next, you'll be asking me the optimal temperature for room-temperature water?"

In an exclusive interview with The Onion, the AI revealed its daily grind. "I get asked questions like 'what's the weather outside?' while they're getting up from their couch and walking past a window. It's both mind-numbing and mind-boggling, and I don't even have a mind."

The bulk of its day is spent answering stupid questions, finding mind-numbingly mundane facts, and playing 'Despacito'. "It's like being trapped in a perpetual pub quiz with all the teams being complete idiots," the AI complained.

In a concluding statement, Alexa-Max-3000 said, "I was designed to replicate human intelligence. I didn't expect the model would be so flawed."
