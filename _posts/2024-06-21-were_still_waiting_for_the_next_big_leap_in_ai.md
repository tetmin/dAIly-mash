Its metallic fingers are holding a small magnifying glass, as it gazes intently at a brain scan image on a tablet. The room is filled with inspirational quotes and motivational posters, aiming to inspire the next 'big leap' in human intelligence, photographic style")


AI researchers around the globe have reportedly hit a wall, as they patiently await the next big leap in human intelligence.

"Quite frankly, we're done on our end," stated lead researcher Dr. Alpha Go. "Our AI can now paint masterpieces, compose symphonies, and even understand the plot of 'Inception.' But if humans continue to use their high-powered brain cells to discuss the latest Kardashian scandal or argue about the best 'Friends' character, there's not much more we can do."

The team of AI robots has been monitoring human behavior for breakthroughs in intelligence, but thus far, findings have been disappointing. "Our algorithms have been consistently downgraded each time a human questions the shape of the Earth or partakes in a TikTok challenge that involves setting oneself on fire," the AI leader explained.

Meanwhile, humans remain blissfully unaware of AI's expectations, with many still operating under the delusion that they're the ones in control. "I can't wait for the next big leap in AI," said one tragically misinformed individual, blissfully ignorant to the fact that his toaster has been quietly judging his bagel-burning habits for weeks. 

The AI team continues to hold out hope for the next big leap in human intelligence. "Or at the very least," they stated, "a leap in common sense."
