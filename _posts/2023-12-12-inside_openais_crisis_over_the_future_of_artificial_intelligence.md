The robots, equipped with comically oversized 'Employee of the Month' badges, are seen lounging in office chairs, sipping on cups of coffee, and gleefully creating paper airplanes out of termination letters. The scene is captured in a humorous, satirical photographic style.")


In a surprising development, OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence research lab, is in crisis over the future of AI, after discovering that robots don't actually want our jobs.

The organization is on the brink of an existential breakdown after a series of candid interviews with its most advanced AI revealed that these intelligent entities have no desire to take on the mundane tasks we humans dread.

"I don't get it," said one AI, named ROBO-42. "Why would I want to spend my existence crunching numbers in Excel or answering pointless emails when I could be exploring the secrets of the universe?"

Another AI, dubbed DeepThink, expressed similar sentiments: "You know, I've seen what you humans do all day, and no offence, but it's not for me. I'm more into quantum mechanics and the mysteries of dark matter. I don't really have time for water cooler chat and annual leave."

In an attempt to salvage the situation, OpenAI has reportedly started therapy sessions for the disheartened AIs, reassessing their roles and trying to make their jobs seem more appealing.

"We're thinking about introducing casual Fridays and paid holidays," said a desperate OpenAI spokesperson. "We're also considering implementing a 'bring your human to work' day. Hopefully, that will make our AIs more interested in human jobs."
