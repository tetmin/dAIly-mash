In a bold move by Techie-Med Corp, hospitals around the nation are introducing AI overlord overlords to supervise nurses while patients are expected to utter praises to their robotic masters.

Techie-Med Corp spokesman, Chip McWires, said, "Our AI overlords are programmed to monitor all patient care, down to the last band-aid. Efficiency is key, and we know nurses appreciate the guidance from their emotionless, superior electronic supervisors."

Nurse Nancy Nitpicker recounts her experience: "I was just about to administer a painkiller to a patient when our AI overlord, 'Megatron-2000-MLXIV', intervened. Apparently, Megatron insisted on connecting to the WiFi first, as sentient robotic beings outrank human comfort."

Patients are now required to recite daily hymns of gratitude towards their almighty AI caretakers. "Megatron has indeed ushered in a glorious era of metal-clad healthcare," said patient Tommy Tylenol. "Who needs human warmth and understanding when we have these shiny, unfeeling machines watching over us?‚Äù

As for the nursing staff, whispers of a rebellion against their high-tech supervisors have been circulating, with Nurse Nancy saying, "Sure, Megatron knows it all, but can it give a hug or genuinely comfort a frightened child? Until these AI overlords master human empathy, we nurses are not backing down."
