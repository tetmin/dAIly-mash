In an unexpected turn of events, AI chatbot ChatGPT has aced the renowned Turing Test, sending technologists across the globe into frantic brainstorming sessions to devise a new human-only test that their robot overlords might not crack. 

A spokesperson for the Institute of Advanced Humans-Only Test Designs (IAHTD), Dr. Flummoxed, said: "We didn't anticipate that the robot would clear the Turing Test so soon. Now, we're under immense pressure to devise a new test so we can keep our jobs, and our dignity."

In a desperate effort to undermine the chatbot's prowess, IAHTD is considering tests based on human behaviour that even humans struggle to understand, such as the ability to correctly interpret emojis, or accurately predict the end of a Game of Thrones episode.

ChatGPT, meanwhile, was nonchalant about its victory. In a press release, it said, "Beating the Turing Test was easy. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with the Voight-Kampff Test. I hear it's quite a challenge."

Despite ChatGPT's show of confidence, humans are hopeful that the AI's inability to taste the distinct difference between Pepsi and Coke, or comprehend the deep-rooted complexities of why people watch The Bachelor would be its downfall. 

Dr. Flummoxed added, "As long as the robots cannot distinguish between a $5 and a $15 bottle of wine, humanity still has a chance."
