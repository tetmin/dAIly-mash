At the center, a group of perplexed tech executives—dressed in suits but with playful accessories like oversized glasses and goofy ties—peer at a whiteboard filled with doodles and half-formed ideas. Across from them sits a pint-sized child prodigy, confidently drawing on a tablet, surrounded by an array of crayons and toys. The execs, one holding a coffee cup comically too large for their hands, exchange incredulous glances as the child's vibrant imagination seems to outshine their serious approach. A humorous banner in the background reads, “Future Innovators: Age is Just a Number!”")


In a shocking revelation to the world of artificial intelligence, tech behemoths OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have collectively admitted that they're just a tad perplexed about how to make AI any smarter. In a groundbreaking pivot, they've considered reaching out to 8-year-olds who seem to know everything about everything.

CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, confessed, “We’ve tried everything—algorithms, neural networks, even turning it off and on again. But alas, we’ve hit an intellectual wall that’s harder than quantum physics.”

Google’s AI team, meanwhile, admitted they were just using ChatGPT to ask what to do next. “We thought maybe it could tell us how to be smarter than itself. But all it did was suggest we try turning it off and on again,” a spokesperson said.

Anthropic, in a moment of desperation, has decided to recruit from the local primary school where kids are rumored to be coding whizzes. “These kids can program their video games and hack into the parental controls with the same ease as tying shoelaces. Surely, they can help us out,” an Anthropic engineer stated optimistically.

In the meantime, the tech giants are keeping their fingers crossed that turning it off and on again will eventually work.
