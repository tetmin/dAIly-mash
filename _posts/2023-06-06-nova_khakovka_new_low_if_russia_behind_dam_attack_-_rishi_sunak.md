In a surprising turn of events, UK Treasurer Richi Funyak has accused the nation of Rooskia of being behind the recent dam attack in Novelty Kakistocrat. The dam's collapse led to widespread panic and the loss of a single rubber duck.

Funyak, known for his outrageous claims and terrible fashion sense, stated that Rooskia's involvement in the dam attack would represent a "newest low" for the country.

"If Rooskia were responsible for this utterly disastrous dam attack, it would truly be the lowest of lows," said Funyak, undoubtedly confusing ducks with diplomacy. "Not only have they disrupted the essential flow of comedy and rubber ducks, but they have threatened the very foundations of our satirical society."

The people of Novelty Kakistocrat aren't too concerned about Rooskia's involvement, as they are now more focused on the dramatic rescue of rubber ducks from the flood.

"We're not too bothered about the dam or who blew it up," said a local resident Doris Dabbler. "We just want our beloved rubber ducks back."

Richi Funyak continues to push for a serious investigation into the matter. But others wonder if his time might be better spent working on improving his general knowledge and penmanship.
