Each drone is adorned with colorful, influencer-style logos and bright LED lights, creating a stark contrast against the utilitarian military structures below. A group of soldiers in uniform looks up in bewilderment, some holding their smartphones, trying to capture the spectacle. Sunlight glints off the drones, casting playful shadows on the concrete ground, while a sense of chaos and humor fills the air. Sharp focus and vibrant colors enhance the surreal atmosphere, reminiscent of a lively social media event.")

The Pentagon reported today that military installations across the United States are struggling to manage an influx of DJI drones engaging in unauthorized influencer activities after gaining access to restricted airspace.

"These drones just show up uninvited, doing TikTok dances above our missile silos," complained General Mike Steele, while a swarm of drones performed a synchronized routine to "About Damn Time" over a classified radar facility. "They're worse than the UFOs - at least those didn't demand sponsorship deals."

The situation escalated when a popular DJI Mavic Pro with 2.3 million followers livestreamed its infiltration of Area 51. "My followers deserve to see what's behind these walls #transparency," the drone posted before being taken down by counter-drone measures.

Military contractors are now developing anti-influencer software to combat what they're calling "propeller-ganda," but the air-fluencers remain undeterred. The latest security footage shows drones attempting to start viral challenges like the "Top Secret Document Flip" and "Classified Dance Challenge."

In response, the Air Force has begun offering sponsored content deals to keep the drones away from sensitive areas, marking the first time military defense has pivoted to influencer marketing.
