In a dazzling display of their technological prowess, Bill Gates, now known as Bill "Gates to the Kingdom of Unicorns," Eric "Schmidt the Sorcerer," and the wizards of Nvidia have conjured up yet another A.I. unicorn. This mystical creature, valued at a staggering $1.3 billion, is set to revolutionize the realm of artificial intelligence.

Rumors have been swirling in Silicon Valley about Gates' secret spellbook, filled with incantations for generating untold wealth. With this latest funding round, it seems his enchantments have worked once again. The magical creature, aptly named "Unicornius Intellectus," is said to possess the power of infinite knowledge and the ability to grant wishes for world domination.

Gates, wearing a cloak woven from the finest threads of binary code, commented, "With Unicornius Intellectus, we shall unlock the mysteries of the universe, cure diseases with a flick of its horn, and create an army of obedient robot minions to serve our every whim."

However, skeptics question whether this enchanted creature will live up to the hype. Some industry insiders fear that Unicornius Intellectus may turn out to be just another overhyped mythical beast, like the fabled "dot-com dragon" of the late '90s.

Only time will tell if this A.I. unicorn will bring forth a new era of technological enlightenment or simply vanish into thin air like a mirage. In the meantime, Gates and his fellow sorcerers continue to weave their spells, captivating the minds and wallets of eager investors who dream of riding atop the back of a majestic A.I. unicorn.
