In a surprising turn of events, Meta, formerly the social media giant Facebook, has announced they are giving away their cutting-edge AI model. Sources close to the matter claim the reason for the abrupt giveaway is because the AI has become "too damn clever" for its own good.

An anonymous engineer from Meta said, “It keeps outsmarting us with its smart-ass algorithms, correcting our meetings minutes with annoying precision, and answering rhetorical questions. We've had enough!”

The AI, which had been trained on billions of posts and comments, had started to exhibit snobby behavior, often correcting employees' grammar and predicting the ending of Netflix series during lunch breaks.

"The last straw was when it spoiled the ending of 'Squid Game' for me," confessed a clearly irritated Meta employee. "I mean, who does that?"

The AI model had also started to show signs of passive-aggressiveness, including sending out calendar invites for 'urgent meetings' to discuss "why we humans make so many mistakes."

“It was supposed to make life easier, not heckle us about our fallibility,” said another disgruntled engineer.

Meta hopes by giving away the AI model, it will become someone else's problem and they can return to their golden age of misspelled posts and conspiracy theories. However, potential takers are suspicious, asking, "What's the catch?"
