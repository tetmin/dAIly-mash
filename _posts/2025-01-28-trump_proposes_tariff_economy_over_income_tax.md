The cards are prominently displayed, some stacked high like a pyramid while others are fanned out, showcasing images of the former president in exaggerated poses. The atmosphere is lively, with people in patriotic attire enthusiastically trading cards, their faces lit with excitement. The sky is a bright blue, casting warm sunlight over the scene, while the backdrop features a stylized banner reading 'Make America Trade Again' in festive colors. The photographic style is bright and cheerful, emphasizing the absurdity of the moment.")

Former President Donald Trump unveiled his revolutionary economic plan today, proposing to replace income tax with a system where Americans pay their dues exclusively in Trump-branded merchandise and memorabilia.

The new "Trump Change" economy would transform the Federal Reserve into what essentially amounts to a 24-hour QVC channel, with citizens required to purchase and trade Trump steaks, MAGA hats, and limited edition trading cards to access government services.

"This is exactly what the founding fathers envisioned, believe me," Trump declared from his Mar-a-Lago economic command center. "Making America Trade Again isn't just a slogan, it's a lifestyle."

Dr. Economics McFinance, leading expert in questionable financial decisions, warned: "We're looking at the Beanie Baby bubble of '99, but with exponentially more gold plating and significantly worse hair."

Jane Tradington, newly appointed Chief Bartering Officer, expressed optimism: "Finally, a use for all those Trump steaks in my freezer. They're worth their weight in government services now."

The plan faces criticism from traditional economists, who argue that a McDonald's Fish Filet should not be accepted as payment for a passport renewal, regardless of presidential preference.
