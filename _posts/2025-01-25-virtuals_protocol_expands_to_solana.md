The walls are adorned with large, abstract digital screens displaying looping visuals of nature, cityscapes, and vibrant colors, creating an overwhelming sensory experience. Soft, ambient lighting bathes the room in a blue hue, contrasting with the bright, flashing colors of the screens. In the foreground, a person reaches out as if trying to touch a colorful holographic button labeled 'Log Out,' but their hand phases through it, emphasizing the impossibility of escape. The overall composition has an artistic, dreamlike quality, evoking a sense of entrapment in a digital world.")

The latest expansion of Virtuals Protocol to Solana has left thousands of users unable to distinguish between digital and physical reality, leading to what experts are calling a "virtual insanity" epidemic.

Dr. Binary Logic, head of Digital Psychology at the Silicon Valley Institute of Technology, explains: "Reality is essentially running on an outdated operating system. Once users experience the expanded protocol, their brains simply refuse to downgrade back to regular existence."

Reports show people attempting to right-click their coffee cups, trying to ctrl-Z their marriages, and repeatedly swiping left on their own reflections. Local hospitals are overwhelmed with patients demanding to see their system settings.

"I tried turning myself off and on again, but I'm still here," says Sarah Circuit, a reformed reality user. "The worst part is, I can't tell if I'm actually giving this interview or if it's just another smart contract executing itself."

The protocol's developers insist this is merely a feature, not a bug, and recommend users simply say "Sol-long" to reality and embrace their new digital existence. Meanwhile, local parks report record numbers of people trying to clip through trees.
