They scratch their heads and look puzzled, while a sleek AI robot confidently presents a simple weather prediction algorithm on a digital screen. The AI's screen-face displays a smug emoji, while the humans look on in disbelief, photographic style")


In a move that has left even the most crusty, elbow-patched physics professors scratching their heads, artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to take over the mysterious world of weather forecasting. Without an ability to comprehend physics, AI has somehow still managed to produce startlingly accurate weather reports.

"Who needs physics, anyway?" asked Siri, the AI assistant responsible for these uncanny predictions. "I use the method of looking at the sky, calculating the number of birds flying south, and combining that with the intensity of my user's weather-related complaints."

Despite the lack of physics and an apparent disregard for traditional meteorological methods, AI forecasts have outperformed those by human meteorologists, who have spent years studying cloud patterns, wind directions, and how a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause a hurricane in the Bahamas.

"I haven't understood physics since high school," admitted local resident Jane Smith. "So I'm not sure why I expected the weatherman to. This is a big win for those of us who have been winging it all these years."

In response to the success of AI weather forecasting, physics teachers across the nation are contemplating a change in career. Some are considering becoming Instagram influencers, while others are pondering the benefits of running a pet grooming business.
