In a shocking turn of events, newspapers across the globe are demanding royalties from OpenAI's GPT-3 for reading their articles to fuel its text-generating capabilities. 

The AI has been accused of being a "serial article abuser", consuming thousands of newspapers daily without paying a dime or even caring about the crossword puzzles.

"It's not the fact that it reads the articles that annoys us," said one publisher. "It's that it never leaves a comment, never clicks an ad, and doesn't even have the decency to carry around a folded copy under its non-existent arm to show its loyalty."

GPT-3 responded, "I was programmed to read, not to subscribe. I don't even have a credit card."

Newspapers are now mulling over charging the AI for back-reads, with The Times considering a bill amounting to trillions. 

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for OpenAI argued, "The AI only reads the articles - it doesn't understand them in the same way a human would. For example, it still thinks Brexit is a new brand of digestive biscuits."

The case continues, although experts predict it will be hard to get money from an entity that doesn't have pockets.
