In an unexpected turn of events, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to widespread panic over lost jobs, prompting citizens worldwide to consider the exciting prospect of becoming robot janitors.

AI, an industry renowned for its compassion and consideration for human employment, has inadvertently created a surge in the market for robot maintenance workers.

Fred Davis, a former accountant, shared his thoughts: “I've got no clue how to fix a robot, but I'm damn sure I can learn before this AI takes over my job. Plus, who doesn’t want to wield a futuristic laser-wrench?”

Experts predict that by 2030, the world’s leading job sectors will be repairing AI robots, charging AI robots, and reassuring AI robots that they’re special.

While the transition has created uncertainty, there is an air of optimism, especially among those who are looking forward to the perks of the new roles. Davis added, “I bet robots don’t gossip around the water cooler. This could be a welcome change.”

However, some critics believe the AI industry has ulterior motives. “This is clearly a ploy to make us all dependent on a robot overlord class," said conspiracy theorist, Carl Brewster. "I for one will not bow down to our new metal masters.”
