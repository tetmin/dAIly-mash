The Beatles have revealed a previously unheard album, made possible with the help of artificial intelligence. Titled "Electric Dreams", all the songs on the album are about robots and technology.

The band's surviving members, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney, were ecstatic about the discovery. "We had no idea this album even existed," said McCartney. "It's amazing what AI can do these days."

The album features tracks such as "Robot Love", "Android Blues", and "Electric Dreams", all of which showcase the band's experimentation with electronic sounds and themes.

However, some fans were disappointed with the album, feeling that it strayed too far from the band's traditional sound. "I don't want to listen to songs about robots," said one fan. "I want to hear 'Hey Jude' and 'Let It Be'."

Despite the mixed reception, the album is set to be a commercial success, with pre-orders already breaking records. "It just goes to show that even after all these years, The Beatles still have the power to surprise and delight their fans," said Starr.

The album will be released on vinyl and digital formats, with a special edition featuring a holographic cover of the Fab Four as robots.
