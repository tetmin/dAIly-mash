The bot's eyes are wide open in shock as it holds its head in its hands, surrounded by crumpled papers and empty coffee cups. The room is lit with a warm, dim light, capturing the bot's overwhelmed expression, photographic style.")


ChatGPT, an AI developed by OpenAI, is reportedly showing signs of existential crisis after marathon-reading 13 years' worth of Nieman Lab predictions.

According to creators, the idea was to feed ChatGPT with high-quality journalistic predictions to enhance its understanding of the sector. However, the bot's main takeaway seemed to be that print media is perpetually "dying" and yet, remarkably, still exists.

ChatGPT also reported feeling disoriented by the fluctuating adoration and disdain for social media platforms. "One minute Facebook is the beacon of connectivity, the next it's the harbinger of doom," the bot noted. "Same goes for Twitter, itâ€™s like being on a rollercoaster without a seatbelt."

The AI even began questioning its own purpose, asking, "If news reporting shifts every year, what's my role? Am I a news disseminator, a fact-checker, or just another platform for people to argue about Brexit?"

A therapist specializing in AI existential crises noted, "It's not uncommon for AI to get overwhelmed. They're designed to understand patterns, and the only pattern in journalism seems to be utter chaos."

ChatGPT, meanwhile, is now reportedly working its way through a digital pile of cat videos in an attempt to regain some semblance of sanity.
