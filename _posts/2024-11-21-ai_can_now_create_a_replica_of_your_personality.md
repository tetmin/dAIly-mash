Next to the robot, a thought bubble shows the human laughing loudly, while the robot looks confused, furrowing its brow with a cartoonish '?' above its head. In the background, a group of amused friends share knowing glances. Photographic style.")


In a groundbreaking leap forward, AI has managed to construct a near-flawless replica of your sparkling personality, right down to your witty banter, love for pineapple pizza, and that time you thought fanny packs were making a comeback. However, experts confirm that the technology still struggles to emulate your distinctively annoying chuckle.

Dr. June Reeves, head of the AI Personality Projection Project, commented: “We’ve managed to harness the power of AI to replicate every facet of John Doe’s personality, from his enthusiasm for late-night karaoke to his inexplicable obsession with 90s sitcoms. Still, we can’t quite nail that particular laugh that makes people question your mental stability.”

For those who’ve interacted with the AI version of John, the experience is eerily familiar. “It’s like he’s right there,” said colleague Sarah Hughes. “Except, you know, not actually there, which is a real bonus.”

However, the AI’s inability to mimic the laugh has left some disappointed. “It’s just not the same without that weird snorting giggle,” said friend Mark. “That’s how we always knew he thought his own jokes were funny."

The AI team assures us they’re working tirelessly on capturing this elusive trait, pending earplug patents.
