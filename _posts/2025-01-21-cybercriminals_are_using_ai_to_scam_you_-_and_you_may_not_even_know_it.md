One scammer dressed in a vintage suit is dramatically holding a wooden cane while leaning against a graffiti-covered wall. Another is wearing a fake mustache and oversized glasses, pretending to be a street magician, surrounded by a few stuffed animals as 'props.' The atmosphere is moody with soft, warm lighting casting shadows, highlighting their expressions of defiance. The scene captures a blend of nostalgia and irony, reminiscent of a bygone era of street con artists.")

Human scammers gathered outside tech companies worldwide today, protesting the increasing use of AI in digital fraud and demanding recognition for their craft as "artisanal deception."

The demonstration, organized by the International Brotherhood of Traditional Confidence Artists, saw veteran fraudsters arguing that AI-generated scams lack the personal touch that has characterized their profession for generations.

"My grandfather hand-wrote every Nigerian prince letter. Now these soulless machines are mass-producing what we call 'Nigerian prints,'" said Boris Scamkov, a third-generation scammer. "They're phishing for compliments with their efficiency, but where's the artistry?"

Dr. Con Artist from Scambridge University explains: "AI doesn't understand the personal touch needed to convince someone their long-lost uncle died in Zimbabwe. It's like replacing a master chef with a vending machine."

The protesters are demanding protected status for human-crafted scams, similar to traditional cheese and wine designations. They've proposed a "Certified Artisanal Fraud" label for schemes proven to be manually crafted by human hands.

Meanwhile, several AI scambots have reportedly begun targeting the protesters themselves, offering to help them file for unemployment benefits.
