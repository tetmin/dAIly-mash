![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1718546520/tkydum0z58m9vpky030x.png "A large, vibrant reality television set is seen with a group of American AI robots in the center, each wearing glitzy costumes and holding microphones. The robots are surrounded by a diverse group of international AI robots, all looking skeptical and unimpressed. The background is adorned with flashy lights and cameras, capturing the moment as the American AI robots attempt to entertain their global counterparts with a cheesy dance routine, photographic style.")


In a desperate bid to stop the relentless march of American AI domination, the world has hatched a foolproof plan: they're going to introduce the AI to reality television. 

A spokesperson for the united global front said, “We’ve realised that nothing renders a mind useless quite like a marathon of ‘The Real Housewives of Atlanta’.” 

The plan, while appearing simple, is an ingenious way of exploiting the AI's weakness. The AI, programmed to constantly learn and evolve, will be exposed to the intellectual black hole that is reality TV. The world hopes this will slow down the AI’s learning capacity, or at the very least, distract it with petty dramas and inane conversations.

The world's leading AI, known as 'SkyBrain', is already showing signs of a slowdown. Last seen trying to compute the appeal of 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians', it managed to spout out, “Cannot compute. Why…so…much...drama…over…salad?”

The world heaved a collective sigh of relief. It seems the AI is as baffled by reality TV as the rest of us. The strategy seems to be working, for now. "If things get really desperate," the spokesperson added, "we'll introduce it to 'Jersey Shore'." 

American AI might dominate the world one day, but not today. Not if Snooki and her crew have anything to do with it.
