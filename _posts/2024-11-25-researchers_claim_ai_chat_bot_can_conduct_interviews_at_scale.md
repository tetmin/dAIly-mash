Each chatbot has oversized ears adorned with cartoonish headphones, furiously typing on tiny laptops while pretending to take notes. One chatbot tilts its head, looking intently at a perplexed human journalist sitting across from them, who is holding a microphone, wearing a bemused expression. The room is decorated with motivational posters like “Active Listening: The Key to Great Journalism”. Photographic style.")


In a groundbreaking development set to revolutionize journalism, researchers have announced that AI chatbots are now capable of conducting interviews at scale. The only remaining challenge? Teaching them to nod along blankly while feigning interest—a skill previously perfected by human journalists.

Dr. Rob Algorithm, lead researcher behind the study, proudly proclaimed, "Our chatbot can now ask key questions like 'How does that make you feel?' and 'Could you elaborate on that?' It's almost as if they're genuinely interested in the answers."

Early trials, however, showed mixed results. One chatbot, when interviewing a celebrity about their new memoir, responded with "I don't understand emotions, but tell me more about your feelings" in a tone best described as 'enthusiastically robotic.'

To combat this, developers have added an array of pre-programmed responses, including "That's fascinating," and "Uh-huh," which are designed to be interjected at random intervals to simulate human engagement.

Dr. Algorithm is optimistic. "We believe that by next year, our chatbots will be able to conduct interviews so convincingly that subjects will barely notice they're talking to a glorified version of their phone assistant. The future of journalism is truly here, and it's battery-powered."
