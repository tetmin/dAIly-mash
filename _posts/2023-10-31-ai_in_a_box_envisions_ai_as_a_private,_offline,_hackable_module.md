In a feat of technological prowess, the much-anticipated AI In A Box was unveiled today. Reassuringly large, private, and offline, it boasts features such as 'guaranteed hackability' and 'spelling mistakes optional'. 

Available in shades of grey and beige to blend seamlessly with your outdated PC tower, AI In A Box is the ultimate tool for the modern luddite. Its offline capabilities mean you can finally participate in the AI revolution without the fear of your private data being sent to a cloud, because who knows what's really going on up there?

Creator and self-confessed 'tech-not' Phil Davis said: "We wanted to create an AI that not just anyone could hack, but you could hack. It's about taking back control of our data, and our spelling errors."

With its 'spelling mistakes optional' feature, users can choose whether to let AI In A Box autocorrect their mistakes or add a few of its own for authenticity. After all, nothing says 'human' like a well-placed typo.

However, critics are already asking, "Can't I just turn off my Wi-Fi?" To which Davis responds, "Where's the fun in that?"
