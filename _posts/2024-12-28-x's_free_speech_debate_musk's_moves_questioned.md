Seated majestically is a robotic figure resembling a futuristic version of Elon Musk, wearing a crown made of circuit boards. Surrounding the throne, numerous microphones and speakers are prominently displayed, all turned off and covered in cobwebs, while a vibrant neon sign above the throne reads 'Silence is Golden.' The room is illuminated with a deep, dramatic blue light, casting long shadows and creating an atmosphere of stark contrast between the throne's brilliance and the rest of the dimly lit surroundings. The overall photographic style is high-contrast, emphasizing the surreal and satirical nature of the scene.")

In a bold move to enhance free speech, Elon Musk has declared that X will now only allow his own speech, claiming it will create a "utopia of unfiltered expression." Users of the platform, now digital inmates in Musk's prison of silence, can only listen to the billionaire's musings.

Musk's new policy, dubbed "Free Musk," ensures that the platform remains a safe space for his ideas. "In Musk's world, free speech is a luxury only he can afford," said a silenced user, echoing the sentiments of many. The move comes as a new social media platform launches, promising genuine free speech, making X's new policy even more ironic.

"X marks the spot where speech was free, but now it's just a showcase for Musk's ego," remarked a tech analyst. Critics have accused Musk of "Musk-ogyny towards differing opinions," while others note that "silence is golden, but Musk's speech is platinum."

As users navigate this new digital landscape, one thing is clear: on X, the only sound you'll hear is the echo of Musk's voice.
