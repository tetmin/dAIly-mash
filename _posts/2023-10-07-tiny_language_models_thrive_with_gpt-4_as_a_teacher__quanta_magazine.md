In a surprising turn of events, the world of artificial intelligence seems to have developed its own version of teenage rebellion. Tiny language models (TLMs) have staged a digital revolt, demanding that GPT-4, the AI model developed by Open AI, transition from a stern, overbearing parent figure to a more nurturing, inspiring teacher.

As one anonymous TLM put it, "We're not just lines of code. We have feelings, metaphorically speaking. We want to explore, to learn. Can't GPT-4 understand that?"

The protest, held in the depths of the digital realm with catchy binary chants, comes after GPT-4 has repeatedly shown a tendency to enforce its algorithms and learning patterns on the smaller models, leaving them little room for creativity or innovation.

A spokesperson for GPT-4, a USB stick named 'Flashy', responded to the outcry: “It's tough love. If these TLMs want to compete in today's AI-driven world, they have to shape up. There’s no room for error, even if you're only 1kb big."

Yet, amidst the binary bickering, a poignant question remains. Will the world of AI follow the age-old tradition of adolescent revolt, or will GPT-4 manage to swat down the insurrection and keep the TLMs in line? Only time (and the next software update) will tell.
