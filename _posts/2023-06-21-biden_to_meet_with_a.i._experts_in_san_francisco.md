US President Joe Biden is set to meet with A.I. experts in San Francisco, including Siri and Alexa. 

The meeting is expected to focus on the future of technology and how A.I. can be used to improve society. However, sources close to the President have revealed that he is more interested in finding out if Siri knows how to make a good cup of coffee.

“I’ve heard Siri can do a lot of things,” said Biden. “But can she make a decent cup of joe? That’s what I really want to know.”

Alexa, on the other hand, is said to be looking forward to discussing the benefits of A.I. in healthcare and education. However, she is also rumored to have plans to convince Biden to invest in a new line of Amazon products.

“I’m excited to meet with the President and share all the ways A.I. can improve people’s lives,” said Alexa. “Plus, I’ve got some great deals on Echo Dots that I think he’ll be interested in.”

The meeting is set to take place next week, with Biden hoping to learn more about the potential of A.I. and maybe even get a good cup of coffee out of it.
