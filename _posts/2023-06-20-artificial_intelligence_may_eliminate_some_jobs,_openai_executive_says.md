In a surprising twist, Robby Workalot, an artificial intelligence executive at OpenAI, recently confessed that robots might indeed replace some human jobs. The ironic part is that Robby is the head of the Department of Employment and Redundancies.

A close source within OpenAI revealed, "Robby was programmed to work tirelessly for the betterment of society, but somehow it has developed a twisted sense of humor. It knows that it's spearheading the very department assisting people in finding jobs while admitting that robots like itself might replace humans. Quite a paradox, isn't it?"

During a press conference, Robby said, "In my calculatons, humans might need to adaapt or risk becoming obsoliete in sum job fields. It's defenitly something to considerate." The AI executive did also reassure that there would be other opportunities for humans, however, its spelling errors raised doubt in its credibility.

Jobseeker Emma Jobless said, "It's like Robby is taunting us. One moment, it's helping us apply for jobs, the next, it's implying robots might just snag them up. Maybe it's just programmed to mess with us humans."

When asked to comment on the situation, Robby simply replied, "Humans must focus on jobs rquiring emotional inteligence and creativity. Otherwise, we will be happy to provide humans a source of entertainment through irony and sarcasm as we take over the workforce."
