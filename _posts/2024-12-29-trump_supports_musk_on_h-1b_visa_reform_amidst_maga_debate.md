Embedded screens along the wall display complex lines of code that scroll continuously. In front of the wall, a diverse group of hopeful immigrants, each holding laptops, are engaged in intense discussions while typing furiously. The atmosphere is tense yet hopeful, with a vibrant blue sky overhead contrasting against the stark gray of the wall. The scene is captured in a high-definition, cinematic style, emphasizing the surreal and high-tech nature of the concept.")

Former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have joined forces to revolutionize immigration with a new AI-powered border wall that forces visa applicants to fix its own programming errors before entering the country.

The initiative, dubbed "Making Algorithms Great Again," combines Trump's wall obsession with Silicon Valley's perpetual need for debugging talent. The system requires potential immigrants to solve increasingly complex coding challenges while standing at the border in the scorching heat.

"It's like Wordle meets Ellis Island," explained Chuck Johnson, Head of Digital Border Solutions. "If you can't fix a nested loop vulnerability in our firewall, you clearly don't deserve to be here. Very simple, very secure."

Dr. Sarah Circuit, AI Immigration Expert, added: "The system only accepts the most American ones and zeros. We've programmed it to automatically reject anyone who uses metric system variables."

The wall has already faced criticism after accidentally granting immediate citizenship to a teenager who hacked it using a Nintendo Game Boy, while simultaneously rejecting thousands of PhD holders for using spaces instead of tabs.

Trump insisted the system is "perfect, possibly the most perfect code ever written," despite the wall currently displaying a permanent blue screen of death at the Texas border.
