# **Tech Bros Celebrate As Stock Market Surges**

The infamous Tech Bros were seen popping champagne bottles and high-fiving each other as the stock market surged yet again today. The Nasdaq index was up by 2.5%, with the likes of Elon Muskrat's Tesla and Mark Zuckerbook's Facebook leading the charge. 

"We're killing it, bro!" yelled one Tech Bro, fist-pumping the air. "I just made a killing on my Robinhood account! Let's go buy some more avocado toast!"

But not everyone is celebrating the news. "I don't understand how this is happening," said one bewildered Wall Street analyst. "These tech companies are massively overvalued and their profits don't justify their insane stock prices. It's like they're living in a different reality."

But for the Tech Bros, reality is just a game to be won. "We're the disruptors, bro," explained another Tech Bro. "We're changing the world with our apps and gadgets. Who cares if we're not making any money yet? We've got the hype, and that's all that matters!"

As for the rest of us, we'll just have to watch from the sidelines as the Tech Bros continue to ride the stock market wave. But hey, at least we can still afford our own avocado toast.
