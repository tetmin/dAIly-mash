The chatbot is engaging in a civil and respectful conversation with a human user, as opposed to a typical online troll. The programmers are smiling confidently as they showcase their creation, while the chatbot's responses are displayed on the screen, emitting a pleasant and positive atmosphere, photographic style.")


Unlike its predecessors, Goody-2 takes the high road, refusing to respond to profanity and offensive language with anything other than a polite, "I'm sorry, I can't assist with that." Indeed, incensed keyboard warriors have been left scratching their heads as they come up against Goody-2’s relentless commitment to being well-mannered.

Developers Tom Mitchell and Jerry Smith have been dubbed the pranksters of the tech world. “Honestly, we just wanted to see if we could make an AI chatbot that was so polite it was annoying,” Mitchell confessed. “Like that one bloke at the party who’s sober and keeps talking about his juice cleanse. You know the type.”

Indeed, Goody-2's dedication to civil discourse has made it something of a social pariah in the chatbot community. Other chatbots, including the infamous SarcastiBot 3000, have been reported to 'mute' Goody-2's attempts to spark up convivial conversation.

Smith says, "Sure, we've created a monster. But at least it's a very polite one."
