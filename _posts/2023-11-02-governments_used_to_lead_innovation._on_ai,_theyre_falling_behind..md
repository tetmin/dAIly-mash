In what some are calling the technological equivalent of watching paint dry, government bodies worldwide have been accused of being overtaken by artificial intelligence - not just in scientific advancement but in the realm of sheer incompetence as well.

AI, or 'Artificial Inaptitude', as it is being cheekily rechristened by many, has seemingly surpassed even the notoriously low bar set by international bureaucracies in their ability to disappoint and confound.

Simon Williams, a local man who once had to deal with the DMV, remarked on this development with a resigned shrug, saying, "It's like watching a sloth and a turtle compete in a 100-meter sprint. Except both are wrapped in red tape."

Indeed, AI's ability to generate incomprehensible error messages, misinterpret simple instructions and generally make a hash of things was previously the sole domain of government departments. But it appears that the marvel of modern technology has successfully replicated this inefficiency, leaving governments to play second fiddle.

A government spokesperson, visibly ruffled by the accusations, defended their debatable position as the reigning kings of bungling. "We've been leading in incompetence for centuries," the spokesperson said. "We're not going to be overtaken by a few lines of code. We're the government, dammit!" 

Meanwhile, AI researchers are reportedly working on their next project: a machine that can lose your mail faster than the post office.
