Eager to relive the glory days of struggling to make ends meet and suffering through an economic crisis, the Bank of Humorington has shockingly decided to implement additional rate hikes. The announcement has left citizens scratching their heads and yearning for those heady days of 1933's Great Depression.

A Bank of Humorington spokesperson, Penny Pincherton said, "We understand the golden years were rough, but there's just something so nostalgic about a good ol' financial downturn. We believe it's essential to maintain a healthy dose of economic depression in order to remain grounded and connected to our roots."

Citizens of Humorington couldn't be more thrilled with the decision, with many already planning Great Depression-themed parties and dusting off their old breadline playlists.

Doris Brokington, a local resident, is excited to bring back her grandmother's money-saving recipes. "Why pay for a delicious three-course meal when you can have a tasty bowl of gruel? It's both rustic and thrifty – the perfect combo!"

Despite the reservations of a few naysayers, the Bank of Humorington remains committed to giving its citizens a taste of the good ol' days with a hearty sprinkle of financial strife and a dash of economic instability. So here's to 1933, a year that will surely inspire great memories...and horrible financial decisions.
