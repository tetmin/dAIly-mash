In a stunning revelation, a group of highly respected experts recently announced that they are "not completely certain" whether Artificial Intelligence is indeed poised to take over everything as feared by most sci-fi movies enthusiasts. 

The revelation was made by Professor Simon Barnard, head of the 'Guessing What AI Will Do Next' department at the University of Madeupname. According to Barnard, “We've been crunching a lot of numbers, drawing graphs, and even using AI to understand AI. But the final result is still as clear as mud. We may be on the verge of a robot apocalypse, or we might just be making a big fuss about a bunch of glorified toasters. We're not totally sure yet.” 

The professor added, “The indicators are mixed. For example, my smart toaster tried to burn my house down last week, but my Alexa still can’t figure out how to play my favorite song without me spelling it out letter by letter. So, it’s really a toss-up at this point.”

However, the professor still advocates for a cautious approach. "Just to be safe, maybe don't be a jerk to your Roomba. You never know."
