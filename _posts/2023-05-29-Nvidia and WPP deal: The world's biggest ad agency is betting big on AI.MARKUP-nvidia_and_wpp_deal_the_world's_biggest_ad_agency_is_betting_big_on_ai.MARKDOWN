In a move that has left marketing executives scratching their heads, advertising giant **Wacky Pants Productions** (WPP) has announced a deal with tech company **NoodleVision** to go all in on artificial intelligence (AI).

The partnership aims to revolutionize the advertising industry by using AI to create hyper-personalized ads that can predict a customer's every move. The algorithm will analyze everything from a person's shopping habits, to their social media posts, to their blood type, to determine the perfect ad to push.

"I'm excited to announce that we're taking our advertising game to the next level," said WPP's CEO, **Bob McBoberson**. "With AI, we can finally tailor ads to each individual customer's unique needs and desires. This is the future of advertising, and we're leading the charge."

Critics of the partnership have raised concerns about privacy and the potential for AI to be used for nefarious purposes, such as mind control or world domination. However, McBoberson assured the public that their data will be safe with WPP.

"We take our customers' privacy very seriously," he said. "The only thing we'll be using their data for is to sell them more stuff they don't need."

The deal is set to be a game-changer for the advertising industry, but only time will tell if it will lead to a dystopian future ruled by sentient ads.
