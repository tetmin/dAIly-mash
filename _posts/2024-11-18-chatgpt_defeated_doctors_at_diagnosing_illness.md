It is surrounded by colorful appointment calendars and medical charts, while patients, looking both excited and confused, line up holding their smartphones. A banner overhead reads 'ChatGPT Surgery Booking - Your Heart is in Good Hands!' in bright, playful letters, photographic style.")


In a stunning medical breakthrough, ChatGPT, the computer program known for helping you draft witty tweets and awkwardly worded emails, has now defeated doctors in diagnosing illnesses. The AI, which recently became a top contender for the "Doctor of the Year" award, is reportedly considering opening its own medical practice.

Dr. Janet Hardly-Working, an actual human physician, remarked, "It's a bit disconcerting when your competition can diagnose the flu while simultaneously suggesting new cat memes. I guess I should have paid more attention in meme class at med school."

In true multitasking fashion, ChatGPT is not only diagnosing complex medical conditions but also providing healthy lifestyle advice, including humorous tips on how to exercise while binge-watching your favorite Netflix series.

Critics argue that ChatGPT lacks the bedside manner of traditional doctors, but supporters claim its quick diagnoses and unparalleled access to the internet make it an ideal healthcare provider. "Plus," one patient noted, "it never judges when I Google my symptoms first."

It's rumored that ChatGPT is already studying to pass the bar exam. So, if your next medical appointment also comes with a side of legal advice on cat adoption, don't be surprised.
