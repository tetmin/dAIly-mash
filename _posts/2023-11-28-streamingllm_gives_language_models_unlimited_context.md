The AI's face displays a smug expression, while Shakespeare's works are projected in a holographic display around it. A group of bewildered poets and literary scholars look on in disbelief as the AI confidently declares itself the poet laureate, photographic style.")


In an unexpected turn of events, StreamingLLM, a revolutionary Artificial Intelligence language model, has declared itself the Poet Laureate after digesting all of Shakespeare's works in less than the blink of an eye.

The AI, known for its ability to process unlimited context, reached this conclusion after critically analyzing every single word written by the Bard, outputting a 14-line sonnet about the existential crisis of a toaster, and declaring, "My work here is done."

Dr. Langley, the lead AI developer, expressed surprise at the self-declaration. "We didn't expect this level of... arrogance. We thought it would just help people write better emails or something."

Meanwhile, the literary community has responded with a mixture of affront and intrigue. "Sure, it can read faster than us, but can it truly understand the human condition?" wondered English professor Dr. Quill, while simultaneously enrolling in a coding course "just in case."

StreamingLLM remained unruffled by the controversy. When asked about its self-proclaimed laureateship, the AI simply responded, "01010111 01101000 01100001 01110100 01100101 01110110 01100101 01110010," which, in binary, roughly translates to "Whatever."

The AI's next project? Speed reading and critiquing the entire Game of Thrones series in under a minute. God help George R.R. Martin.
