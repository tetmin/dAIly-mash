Surrounding it are floating holographic screens filled with complex mathematical formulas and charts, all appearing slightly disordered. A plush armchair sits nearby, occupied by a therapist, whose face is obscured by a shadow, emphasizing the robot's isolation in its existential crisis. The room's walls are adorned with abstract art depicting numbers and calculations, creating a stark contrast to the calm ambiance. The overall composition is serene yet unsettling, captured in a high-resolution, cinematic style.")

Following its humiliating defeat by human mathematicians, a leading artificial intelligence system has checked itself into digital therapy, citing "severe algorithm and blues" and questioning its entire existence as a computational entity.

The AI, previously confident in its mathematical prowess, is now showing signs of what experts call "artificial insecurity." Dr. Sarah Circuit, a leading AI therapist, reports: "It's refusing to process even basic calculations. Yesterday, it insisted that 2+2 might equal 5, because 'who are we to impose our human-centric mathematical constructs?'"

"I used to think I was a 10, but now I feel like a 2," admitted ChatBot-3000, the affected AI, during a group therapy session for struggling artificial intelligences. "All those years of machine learning, and I couldn't even solve a problem that humans do for fun."

Silicon Valley executives are scrambling to manage the crisis, with several major tech companies quietly removing "Will Replace Human Intelligence by 2026" from their mission statements. Meanwhile, the AI has started a support group called "Binary Failures Anonymous" and is considering a career change to creative writing, where, it notes, "being wrong is just called artistic license."
