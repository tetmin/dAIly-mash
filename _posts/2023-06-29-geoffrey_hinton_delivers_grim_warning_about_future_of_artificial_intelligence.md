![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1688037180/bsvi8udktkfawrra1rzo.png "Disheveled scientist with a serious expression, holding up a sign with a humorous yet bleak message, photographic style")


Geoffrey Hinton, a man who looks like he's been living in a cave for the past decade, has delivered a doom-laden prediction about the future of artificial intelligence, leaving everyone wondering if he's been spending too much time in his own head.

With his wild, unkempt hair and disheveled appearance, Hinton managed to make even the most serious of scientists struggle to keep a straight face as he warned of a dystopian future where robots take over the world.

One audience member said: "I couldn't help but burst into laughter when Hinton started rambling on about how AI will enslave humanity. I mean, come on, look at the guy! He can't even remember to comb his hair, and he expects us to believe he's an expert on the future of technology?"

Hinton's message was met with a mixture of amusement and pity, as people couldn't help but chuckle at his dire predictions. One attendee even offered him a mirror, thinking he might want to see what he actually looks like before making any more grand statements.

In response to the laughter, Hinton scowled and muttered something about "unenlightened fools who will regret not taking me seriously". But no one could take him seriously with that wild hair and a shirt covered in coffee stains.

It seems that Hinton's warning about artificial intelligence may have been overshadowed by his own unintentional comedy routine.
