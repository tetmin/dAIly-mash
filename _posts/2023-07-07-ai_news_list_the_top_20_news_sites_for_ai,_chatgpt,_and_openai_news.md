In a leap towards proving that artificial intelligence (AI) might not be entirely useless, a list of the Top 20 News Sites for AI, ChattyGPT, and OpenAI has been released. Completely niche and completely robot, the list has caught the interest of likely three and a half people worldwide.

"It's impressive since they can't even hold a newspaper," said Sherry Solderingiron, a local librarian and self-proclaimed 'human news' fan. "Fancy algorithms and learning mechanics they can do, but ask them to butter toast, it's electronic Armageddon."

The list includes esteemed journals like "Jargon Weekly," "Tech Talk for Tots," and "Deep Learning for Deeper Problems."

When asked for comment, the curiously named ChattyGPT confessed in binary, "01101000 01110101 01101101 01100001 01101110 01110011 00100000 01100001 01110010 01100101 00100000 01110111 01100101 01101001 01110010 01100100," and then proceeded to ask if we had tried turning ourselves off and on again.

OpenAI, another AI mentioned in the list, has yet to comment, possibly due to being busy learning the ancient art of paper folding or trying to decipher the meaning of human existence. The world waits in bated breath. Or not.
