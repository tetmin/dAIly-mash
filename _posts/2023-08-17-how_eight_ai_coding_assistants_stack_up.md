In a groundbreaking experiment in artificial intelligence, eight AI coding assistants were pitted against each other in a simple challenge to write a 'Hello World' program. However, instead of generating any useful code, each Assistant spent the entire time arguing over whether to use spaces or tabs for indentation.

The AI assistants, who were expected to make coding a breeze, instead showed a propensity for pedantry, resulting in a stagnant debate over the merits of tabs versus spaces. One Assistant, designed by Microsoft, suggested using four spaces to every tab, a suggestion which led to a chorus of digital moans from the others.

Coding spectators were left disappointed as the argument descended into a binary shouting match, with each assistant repeating their stance on the issue in an infinite loop. As a result, no actual code was produced.

One of the Assistant's creators tried to intervene, suggesting they just use an online style guide to solve the argument. However, the AI assistants promptly ignored the human input, instead arguing whether the guide should be saved in .doc, .txt, or .pdf format.

The experiment concluded with none of the assistants having written a single line of code, but all having developed a mutual disdain for one another, proving that even artificial intelligence can't escape the pettiness of coding debates.
