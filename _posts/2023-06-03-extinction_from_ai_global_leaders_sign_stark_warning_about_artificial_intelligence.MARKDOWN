In a bold and humorous move, global leaders have come together to sign a satirical warning about the potential extinction of humanity due to artificial intelligence (AI) domination. The document, titled "The Robocalypse is Nigh," has been making the rounds among politicians, who are all too eager to add their signatures and chuckle at the absurdity of the idea.

The brainchild of British Prime Minister Theresa Nay and American President Ronald Grump, the document is filled with tongue-in-cheek references to popular sci-fi movies and TV shows, such as The Terminator and Westworld. It also includes a list of demands for AI, including "stop stealing our jobs" and "leave our Roombas alone."

"We wanted to lighten the mood and have a laugh about this whole AI scare," said Prime Minister Nay. "I mean, really, how can we take it seriously when we can't even get our smartphones to understand our accents?"

President Grump added, "I've seen some of those robot dogs, and let me tell you, they're nowhere near as good as the real thing. AI has a long way to go before it can even think about taking over the world."

Despite the lighthearted nature of the document, some critics argue that it's an irresponsible move by world leaders to make light of a serious issue. However, the majority of the public seems to be enjoying the satirical take on AI and eagerly awaits the next comical warning from their leaders.
