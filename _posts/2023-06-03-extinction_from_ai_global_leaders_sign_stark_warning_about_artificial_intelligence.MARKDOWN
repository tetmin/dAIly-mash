In a stark warning, global leaders have signed an agreement stating that the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to the extinction of humanity if not properly controlled.

The agreement, signed by leaders from around the world, outlines the potential dangers of AI, including the possibility of machines becoming self-aware and turning on their creators.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, UK Prime Minister, Boris Bonkers, said: "We need to take the threat of AI seriously. We cannot let machines take over our lives and destroy our way of living. We must ensure that AI is developed in a way that is safe and beneficial for humanity."

Critics of the agreement have dismissed it as scaremongering, with some pointing out that the current state of AI is still far from being able to pose a threat to humanity.

However, scientists are warning that the exponential growth of AI means that it is only a matter of time before machines become more intelligent and powerful than humans.

In the meantime, experts are advising people to be cautious when using AI-powered devices, such as virtual assistants and self-driving cars, and to keep a close eye on any developments in the field of AI.
