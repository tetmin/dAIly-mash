Global leaders have signed a stark warning about a potential threat from artificial intelligence, but only after they figured out what it actually is.

The document, which was signed by leaders from around the world, stated that AI could pose a "existential threat" to humanity and called for more research to be done into the technology.

However, it was later revealed that many of the leaders didn't actually know what AI was and were just signing the document to look like they were taking action.

French President Emmanuel Macron said: "I thought AI was just a fancy way of saying 'artificial insemination'. I signed the document because I didn't want to look stupid in front of the other world leaders."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel added: "I thought AI was some new type of cheese. I didn't want to be the only one not signing the document, so I just went along with it."

The US President, who was also in attendance, said: "I still don't know what AI is, but I'm pretty sure it's not as bad as the fake news media is making it out to be."

Despite the confusion, the warning has been praised as a step in the right direction in the fight against AI, whatever it may be.
