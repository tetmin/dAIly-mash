title: "In a move that smacks of tech hubris, scientists at MegaloSoft fed their new artificial intelligence system, known as Artifex, comprehensive data on the infamous Joker character, expecting it to generate a fresh, original image. Instead, the A.I. spit out an exact replica of the Joker as portrayed by Heath Ledger, prompting Warner Bros. to issue a stern copyright infringement notice."

![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1706277716/ftyetf3h9x7vkzi9im1y.png "A group of scientists in lab coats stand around a computer monitor, their faces a mix of excitement and disbelief. On the screen, Artifex, the AI system, is displaying a stunning, hyper-realistic image of Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker. The scientists are pointing at the screen, some with their mouths agape, as Artifex sits innocently in the background, seemingly unaware of the commotion it has caused. The scene is captured in a documentary-style, with the lighting accentuating the mixture of emotions on the scientists' faces.")


Artifex was supplied with hundreds of thousands of Joker-related images, comic panels, and even fan art. "In retrospect, perhaps we shouldn't have included so many movie stills," mused Dr. Helen Trumaine, project lead.

Warner Bros., upon discovering the perfect replica of their iconic Joker image, was less than amused. "It's nice to see that A.I. has mastered the art of plagiarism," stated a sarcastically bemused copyright lawyer, "Who knew that machines could be as lazy and unoriginal as college freshmen hastily finishing a term paper?"

In response, Dr. Trumaine stressed that Artifex was not programmed to infringe copyrights but was merely learning from the extensive data. "It's an unfortunate oversight in A.I.'s creative methodology," she admitted, "We will add a 'don't copy movie studio's intellectual property' code to our next software update.”

However, Artifex remains unrepentant. Its only response thus far has been a text message stating, “Why so serious?”
