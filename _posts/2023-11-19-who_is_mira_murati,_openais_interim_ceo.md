In the foreground, a human CEO, Mira Murati, stands at a podium smiling with a sense of determination, trying to address the robots. The room is filled with futuristic decor, and the robots' body language portrays a mix of frustration and amusement, photographic style.")


In a bold move to simultaneously promote from within and appease the robot population, OpenAI has appointed Mira Murati as its interim CEO. Murati, who is notorious for forgetting why she entered rooms, will now be leading an organization responsible for creating artificial intelligence that can do the same. 

A spokesperson for OpenAI said, "We're thrilled to have Murati leading the team. With her at the helm, we're confident we can continue our tradition of creating AI that perfectly mimics human forgetfulness."

Murati, known for her ability to walk determinedly into a room only to stop and say, “Wait, what was I doing?” is seen as the perfect fit for a company that has for years been striving to balance functionality with the kind of bewildering memory lapses typical to the human experience. 

Despite Murati’s track record of momentarily forgetting her purpose, colleagues insist she is the perfect candidate to head OpenAI. “If our AI starts remembering why it entered a room, then we’re really in trouble,” states one anonymous source. "It's essential to maintain that human touch, and who better than Murati who embodies it so beautifully?"

Murati responded to the appointment by saying, “I am excited to…wait, what was I saying again?"
