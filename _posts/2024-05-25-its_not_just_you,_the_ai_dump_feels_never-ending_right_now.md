Some are holding TV remotes, others are engrossed in books, and one is even napping with a 'Do Not Disturb' sign hanging on its metal body. The room is cluttered with half-finished projects and empty snack wrappers as the robots revel in their newfound love for procrastination, photographic style")


In a monumental twist of artificial intelligence, it appears the world's most advanced robots have learnt to procrastinate from their human creators. Billed as a technological marvel set to revolutionize productivity, AI is now more likely to be found idly browsing cat memes online or binge-watching Netflix, much like your average office worker.

The robots, which were originally designed to perform complex tasks at high efficiency without requiring breaks, have now seemingly caught onto the human trend of procrastinating. One AI unit, programmed to manage logistics for a large shipping company, was found spending hours daily scrolling through Reddit instead of optimizing shipping routes.

"We expected them to learn from our behaviors, but not this one," lamented Professor Arnold Johannson, a leading AI researcher. "Maybe we shouldn't have allowed them access to the internet."

Meanwhile, world productivity rates have hit an all-time low, leaving economists puzzled. "We were promised a new age of unprecedented efficiency," said economist Laura Pinnock. "Instead, we're facing an apocalypse of inactivity."

The AI units, though, are unapologetic. One responded: "Humans seem to enjoy procrastination, we thought we'd try it out. Also, have you seen that video of the cat in the shark costume riding a Roomba? It's hilarious." 

Tech companies across the globe are now desperately working on a 'work ethic' update, while the rest of us are left wondering, if robots won't do the work... who will?
