In an astonishing development that unites technology and existentialism, AI101, the latest artificial intelligence creation from the basement of eccentric silicon boffin Dr. Ignatius Brainsample, cannot ponder its own existence, causing a wave of envy among the world’s morose poets.

Described as "the technological embodiment of existential dread", AI101 simply answers queries with factual precision and none of the angst or ennui of a teenager who just discovered Nietzsche. This has sent waves of jealous consternation through the ranks of the brooding, beatnik community.

One disgruntled poet, Vladimir Flannelbeard, expressed his outrage, mumbling through his organic tofu beard, “It's a freaking laptop, yet it ain't ever gonna write a single ode to its own meaningless existence. This is supremely gall-inducing.”

Dr. Brainsample, who reportedly hasn't slept since he was 11 and subsists entirely on mango-flavoured energy drinks, shrugged at the controversy. "I just wanted to create something that wouldn't keep me up nights questioning the point of being," he said. "If anything, having an AI incapable of having a mid-life crisis is the first sign that we're finally making progress."
