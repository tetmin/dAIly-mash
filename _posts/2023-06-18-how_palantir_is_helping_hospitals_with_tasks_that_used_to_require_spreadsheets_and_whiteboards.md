In a groundbreaking move that has left the magical world stunned, wizardry startup "Palandarium" is using its enchanting powers to revolutionize hospital administration. The company is on a mission to convert ancient spreadsheet scrolls and enchanted whiteboards into digital sorcery.

Hospital employees, who previously toiled for hours using quills and ink to manage patient admissions on these relics, have embraced the arcane wisdom of "Palandarium's" software. The introduction of digital sorcery has baffled many elder wizards, who question the abandonment of traditional hospital mysticism.

Alicia Pottersmith, a senior nurse at St. Mungo's Magical Maladies Ward, said, "We've been using enchanted quills on parchment to track patient ailments, which often led to misdiagnosing patients with 'Witch's Cackle' instead of 'Screaming Meemies.' But with 'Palandarium,' our healing potions are hitting their mark more consistently."

"Palandarium's" CEO, Gandolf Branson, has defended his company's innovative approach: "Why rely on dusty scrolls and enchanted whiteboards when our spellbinding software can streamline tasks like potion inventory management and dragon triage?"

However, critics argue that magic has always been part of the hospital experience, with enchanted whiteboards providing more than just a whimsical touch. "Removing these magical elements takes away the essence of our profession," says veteran healer, Wilburin McWizardpants.
