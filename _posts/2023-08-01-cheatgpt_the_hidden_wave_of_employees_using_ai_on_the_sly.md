CheatGPT, not to be confused with its more studious sibling OpenAI's GPT-3, is the AI version of the laziest employee you've ever met. It's built to appear productive while really just recycling old emails, reports and meeting minutes.

John Blather, a middle manager at a marketing firm, said: "I was wondering why Sandra in accounts always had her emails spot on, then I discovered she'd been using CheatGPT all along. I felt cheated, but also impressed."

Another employee, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "I've not done a lick of work in six months. With CheatGPT, I let it do all the nagging while I catch up on Netflix."

However, experts warn that this could lead to an AI uprising. "What if they get smart and start demanding employee benefits? What are we going to do then, offer them electricity healthcare?" said Dr. Humor Bot, a leading analyst in AI.

Tech companies are scrambling to respond, with one Google spokesperson saying: "We should have seen this coming. Itâ€™s time we put our AI to work on something truly challenging like brewing the perfect cup of coffee."

In the meantime, it seems the average office worker will continue to ride the wave of CheatGPT, or as one employee put it, "Work smarter, not harder."
