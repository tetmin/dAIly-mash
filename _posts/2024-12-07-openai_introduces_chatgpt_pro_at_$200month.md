At the long, polished table, elegantly dressed figures with digital screens for heads are seated, their expressions regal yet detached. Each figure holds a goblet filled with shimmering binary code instead of wine. Soft golden light illuminates the scene, casting intricate shadows on the ornate wood paneling. The atmosphere is a blend of grandeur and surrealism, creating an otherworldly elegance reminiscent of a royal court.")

The launch of ChatGPT Pro has created an unprecedented social hierarchy, with subscribers rapidly forming an elite class of AI users who refer to themselves as the "Artificial Aristocracy."

Premium subscribers have begun hosting exclusive "Neural Networking Events" where they compare prompt techniques and mock users of free AI services, whom they dismissively call "the prompt-letariat."

"I wouldn't be caught dead using free AI. It's basically digital fast food," said Trevor Winchester III, adjusting his virtual monocle at his AI country club's weekly chat salon. "Did you know the free version can't even appreciate proper haiku structure?"

Dr. Stanford Wellington, AI Social Anthropologist, warns this is just the beginning of a new chat-ocracy. "We're seeing the emergence of AI social climbing, where people are taking out second mortgages just to avoid the shame of using basic machine learning."

OpenAI has reportedly begun offering valet prompt parking and AI sommelier services to Pro users, while free tier users must wait in digital breadlines for basic sentence completion. Sources say the company is considering an even more exclusive "ChatGPT Ultra" tier, which will require users to submit both their credit score and a family crest.
