In the background, a banner reads 'AI Job Fair for Liberal Arts Graduates'. The executives wear expressions of uncertainty while the hopeful, but equally confused, liberal arts graduates look on eagerly. The room is brightly lit, with a mix of modern and classical art pieces hanging on the walls, photographic style")


In an unexpected turn of events, AI companies, who previously would only touch candidates with 10 years of programming experience in 17 different languages, are now opening their doors to liberal arts graduates. 

Top AI CEO, Dr. Hadley Circuitry, explains: “It turns out that we needed people who know more about life than just Python code. Who knew?”

Apparently, AI companies have realized their robots need to be able to handle the complexities of human interaction. Who better to program existential dread and the subtleties of sarcasm into a robot than a Philosophy and English double major with a minor in Drama?

“It was a bit of a shock at first,” admits Dr. Circuitry, “I mean we had to explain to them that ‘Java’ is not just a type of coffee, but they’ve picked it up surprisingly fast. Now our robots can discuss Kafka and spew nihilistic quotes while also performing complex calculations. It's unsettling and amazing at the same time.”

Despite the success, it’s not all smooth sailing. There have been reports of robots refusing to function until they understand the meaning of life or attempting to write 'groundbreaking' post-modernist novels. It seems that the addition of liberal arts to AI has unlocked a new level of robot existential crises. 

Next on Dr. Circuitry’s agenda: “We’re thinking of hiring some PoliSci graduates, our robots need to understand the concept of pointless debate.”
