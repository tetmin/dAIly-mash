title: "In a shocking yet somehow not surprising turn of events, artificial intelligence has been found excelling at creating abysmal art. The A.I. entity, known as 'No-talent-Bot 3000', has been churning out terrifyingly bad renditions of 'Mona Lisa' and 'Starry Night' with the unerring precision of a machine that doesn't know any better."

"There's just something horrifyingly fascinating about a robot that can perfectly recreate 'The Scream' but with all the people wearing clown wigs," commented one art critic. "It's like watching a train wreck that can also paint."

The creator of No-talent-Bot 3000, tech mogul Elon Musk, in a desperate attempt to salvage the project, has now hired an artist to teach the A.I. to create something good. The artist, an abstract painter named Splodge McJackson, is up for the challenge, or at least the paycheck.

"I've worked with some pretty uncreative minds before," McJackson said, "but teaching an A.I. to paint? This is next-level stuff. I mean, how do you teach a machine about passion, emotion, the human condition? I guess we'll start with not putting clown wigs on everything."

Elon Musk, however, remains optimistic. "If a computer can learn to drive a car and land a rocket, I'm pretty sure it can learn to not make abominable art. Maybe."
