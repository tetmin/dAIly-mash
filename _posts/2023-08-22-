After spending a grand total of 15 minutes reading a Wikipedia article on artificial intelligence, local resident Tom Stuyvesant has declared himself an expert on the subject and insists he "totally gets" how AI works.

Stuyvesant, a man whose technical prowess traditionally extends to turning on the TV and occasionally resetting a Wi-Fi router, is now confidently discussing the ins and outs of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning, terms he insists he completely understands.

His wife, Lisa, reports, “He kept saying things about ‘nodes’ and ‘layers’, then nodded to himself like he cracked the code of existence. I don’t think he knows what a node is.”

Despite being unable to explain what a programming language is or how a computer works, Stuyvesant feels absolutely positive he could design an AI system if he "really put [his] mind to it."

When asked for comments, Stuyvesant said, “AI’s simple, really. It’s all about teaching computers to think. Or something like that. I mean you’ve got your layers and your nodes, and...well, it's all there in the Wikipedia article.”

Meanwhile, the world of AI continues its complex and rapid development, blissfully unaware of Tom Stuyvesant’s profound misunderstanding.
