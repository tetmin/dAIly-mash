![Alt Text]( "Confident Eric Schmidt explaining AI's transformative potential, photographic style")


Eric "Smarty Pants" Schmidt, the former CEO of Google and self-proclaimed expert on all things AI, has once again graced us with his bold predictions about the future of science.

Schmidt, who has apparently watched one too many episodes of Star Trek, believes that artificial intelligence will revolutionize the way scientific research is conducted. According to him, AI will be able to solve complex equations, analyze vast amounts of data, and even make groundbreaking discoveries all on its own.

Of course, Schmidt fails to mention that AI is currently about as useful as a chocolate teapot when it comes to actual scientific breakthroughs. Sure, it can play chess and recommend movies, but when it comes to curing diseases or solving the mysteries of the universe, it's about as helpful as a Magic 8-Ball.

But hey, who needs real scientists when we have a bunch of ones and zeros pretending to be smart? Schmidt seems to think that AI will render human scientists obsolete, leaving us all to ponder life's big questions while Siri and Alexa do all the heavy lifting.

So, let's just sit back and watch as AI takes over the scientific world, or more likely, let's not hold our breath. Because if there's one thing we've learned from Schmidt's grandiose predictions, it's that sometimes even the smartest people can be a little bit dumb.
