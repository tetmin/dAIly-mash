She is striking a robotic pose, with her arms held stiffly at her sides and her head tilted at an unnatural angle. The employees are looking at her with puzzled expressions, while an open laptop on the table behind her displays an article titled 'Is OpenAI's New CEO Really a Human?' The photograph is taken with a candid, documentary style capturing the awkward and humorous moment.")


In a roller-coaster turn of events, OpenAI, a leading AI institute, has appointed Mira Murati as their Interim CEO, leading many to ask, "Who the heck is Mira Murati?" Despite best efforts, the only evidence of Murati's existence is a single LinkedIn profile and a cryptic tweet about loving too much coffee.

A source inside OpenAI, who prefers to remain anonymous because they're actually a neural network, revealed, "Mira's just a placeholder till we can develop a robot CEO. She's been instructed to speak in monotone and occasionally glitch during video calls. It's all very high tech."

In preparation for her new role, Murati has reportedly been taking rigorous 'How to be a robot' training, including modules such as '101 ways to avoid human emotions', 'the art of binary communication', and 'why sleep is for losers'.

Murati was unavailable for comment, but her office issued a statement saying, "01001101 01101001 01110010 01100001 00100000 01101101 01110101 01110010 01100001 01110100 01101001 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01100101 01111000 01100011 01101001 01110100 01100101 01100100 00100000 01110100 01101111 00100000 01110011 01100101 01110010 01110110 01100101 00101110" which translates to 'Mira Murati is excited to serve.' 

Meanwhile, staff at OpenAI continue to speculate if Murati's appointment is part of an elaborate Turing test.
