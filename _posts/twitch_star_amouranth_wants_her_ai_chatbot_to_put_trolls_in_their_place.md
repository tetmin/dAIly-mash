title: "Twitch Sensation Amouranth's Chatbot: The Ultimate Troll Slayer"
---

**Amouranth** has had enough of trolls on her Twitch channel and has decided to unleash her secret weapon: a chatbot that will put them in their place.

Dubbed **TrollSlayer3000**, the chatbot is programmed to detect and respond to any negative comments in the chat. It will call out the trolls for their bad behaviour and publicly shame them.

"I'm tired of these keyboard warriors hiding behind their screens and thinking they can say whatever they want without consequence," said Amouranth. "With TrollSlayer3000, they'll finally get what's coming to them."

The chatbot has already proven to be a huge success, with trolls quickly learning not to mess with Amouranth's stream. In fact, some have even started behaving themselves in fear of being targeted by TrollSlayer3000.

"I used to come into Amouranth's stream and say horrible things, but now I'm too scared to even type in the chat," said one former troll. "That chatbot is no joke."

Amouranth hopes that her chatbot will inspire other streamers to take a stand against trolls and make Twitch a safer and more positive place for everyone.

"I'm just doing my part to make the world a better place, one troll at a time," she said.
