Each of them is animatedly sketching grand plans on a whiteboard filled with nonsensical diagrams of a cartoonish giant robot battling famous tech logos like Apple and Google. A cat wearing a tiny pair of glasses is sitting atop the table, seemingly judging their ambitious ideas, photographic style.")


In a move reminiscent of a plucky mouse taking on an army of well-fed cats, small-time tech player Lightricks has announced its plan to storm the gates of Big Tech with an open-source AI video initiative. Because nothing says "We're serious" quite like betting the farm on a bunch of unpaid coders working from their parents’ basements.

CEO and visionary dreamer, Max Einhorn, stated, “We’re aiming to democratize video editing with cutting-edge AI, which will be collectively built by the entire internet. Sure, why not? It worked for Wikipedia, sort of.”

The initiative has sparked excitement among open-source enthusiasts who are eager to make their mark on the tech world between Netflix binges. Meanwhile, industry giants like Google and Facebook are reportedly quaking in their billion-dollar boots, or at least pretending to while they laugh all the way to their next yacht purchase.

Tech analyst Megan Price commented, “It's a bold move, betting against companies that have more money than several small countries. But who knows? Maybe crowdsourced AI video editing will be the next big thing, right after MySpace makes its triumphant return.”
