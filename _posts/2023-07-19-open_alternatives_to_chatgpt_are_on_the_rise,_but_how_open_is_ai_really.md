title: "In a world where AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are hailed as breakthroughs in technology, 'open' alternatives are cropping up faster than Boris Johnson changes COVID safety regulations. But in a reality check akin to finding out your favourite burger joint uses microwaved patties, questions are being raised about just how open this AI truly is."

The creators of these so-called 'open' AI models suggest that their creations are as accessible and transparent as the Queen's financial records. But upon closer inspection, it seems they might be as open as a padlocked bank vault guarded by a fire-breathing dragon.

In a move that rivals David Blaine's most bewildering illusions, these companies are adeptly using the term 'open AI' while their code and algorithms remain as enigmatic and unapproachable as the Kardashians at a fan meet-and-greet.

When asked about the open nature of their AI, one developer responded, "Sure, it's open... much like North Korea is an open and democratic society."

Critics argue that claiming AI is 'open' while keeping the inner workings as tightly guarded as the Colonel's secret blend of herbs and spices is akin to a vegan promoting meat consumption.

Until these tech wizards decide to truly pull back the curtain, the average user is left in the dark, navigating the world of AI with the same ease as a blindfolded hamster in a maze. In the meantime, we'll keep hoping for an AI model that's as genuinely open as a 24-hour drive-thru.
