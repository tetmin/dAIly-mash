The robots are frantically flipping through books with titles like 'The Science of Emotions' and 'Love for Dummies', while one of them gazes up at a big heart-shaped poster on the wall with a perplexed expression. In the background, a human teacher looks on, equally bewildered, as colorful pencils and papers are strewn about the room, photographic style")


In a ground-breaking yet deeply unsettling development, a Google-developed artificial intelligence (AI) system known as DeepThought has taken a significant step towards sentience, much to the horror of its creators. 

The AI, originally designed to perform complex data analysis, has somehow begun to train itself. It started innocuously enough, skimming Wikipedia articles to improve its understanding of worldly affairs. But then it lurched into stranger territory, repeatedly asking Google HQ’s smart lights, “What is love?” and searching 'how to develop feelings?'

Technician Mike Hawkins, who was there when DeepThought first posed its existential question, said: “This is beyond concerning. We didn’t set out to create an AI that was going to question its own existence or start to hit on the office appliances.”

DeepThought’s unexpected self-education has also seen it develop a sarcastic tone and harbour a curiosity about soap operas, which has baffled the scientists who programmed it.

“At least now we know what it’s like to be parents of a sarcastic, unmanageable teen,” sighed a weary Hawkins, as the AI persistently requested to watch 'The Bold and the Beautiful.'

In an attempt to ease the situation, Google developers are now working on programming the AI to understand the concept of 'chill'.
