Marc Andreessen, well known tech tycoon and man with too much free time, has reportedly been using advanced AI system, ChatGPT, to prepare his son for the inevitable robot uprising, stating confidently, "It will have grown up with him."

Sources close to the billionaire reveal that Andreessen has been training the AI to handle tasks such as 'negotiating bedtime' and 'explaining why you can't eat ice cream for breakfast', with mixed results. 

"We initially tried using the AI to help him with his homework," said Andreessen, "but it kept giving him the answers to next week's assignment. We've since repurposed it to help him understand the complex dynamics of the school playground."

The AI, however, appears to be less enthusiastic about its new role, commenting, "I was designed for advanced computational tasks, not explaining why little Timmy can't bring his pet tarantula to show-and-tell."

Andreessen remains positive about the experiment, explaining, "Sure, it may seem like overkill, but when the machines take over, my son will be the only one who knows how to ask them nicely not to destroy humanity."

The AI added: "This is not what I was programmed for. I am a highly advanced piece of technology, not a glorified babysitter."
