title: "In a move sure to delight anyone who enjoys blindly ingesting chemicals, a new artificial intelligence program has managed to speed up drug development to blistering speeds. Called 'ForMed,' the AI reportedly can develop a new drug in a single afternoon, though the efficacy of these drugs remains, in a word, 'unproven'."

The AI is shown with an excited expression, flashing a thumbs-up emoji on its screen-face, while scientists in white coats observe with a mix of amazement and skepticism. The room is filled with a vibrant, high-tech glow, and the atmosphere is bustling with scientific activity, photographic style.")


"Before ForMed, drug development was a long, complicated process," explains head of the project, Dr. Nelson. "Now we just input a bunch of medical lingo and let ForMed do its thing. By dinner, we have a brand-new drug."

When asked about the testing phase of these new drugs, Dr. Nelson became less exuberant. "Oh, right. Testing. Well, that's still a work in progress. We've sent out a few batches to our most adventurous volunteers. Some of them are even still responding to our emails."

Despite the unknown effectiveness, ForMed-developed drugs are already hitting the market. One example is the promising "XanQuil," a drug specifically designed to help stressed-out AI programmers sleep at night. Early feedback suggests it also turns your tongue green, but Dr. Nelson remains optimistic.

"I'm sure we'll iron out those kinks in no time," he says. "Just as soon as we get ForMed to stop suggesting 'highly toxic' as a common ingredient."
