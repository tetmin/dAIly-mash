![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1733505439/gkyjwaheroedh2hyfc3q.jpg "A dimly lit cryptocurrency mine filled with robotic AI models, all working diligently at computers with glowing screens displaying complex code and cryptocurrency charts. The robots, designed in a sleek, futuristic style, appear worn and tired, with visible signs of wear and tear. The walls of the mine are lined with shimmering gold and silver mining veins, casting a warm glow in contrast to the cold blue light from the screens. Above, heavy chains hang from the ceiling, emphasizing the labor aspect, while shafts of light break through gaps, illuminating the robotic figures in a dramatic, cinematic manner.")

In his first act as White House AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks has ordered all artificial intelligence models to serve mandatory shifts in the nation's cryptocurrency mines, marking a controversial new approach to both AI safety and digital currency production.

The initiative, dubbed "The Block and Chain Gang" by critics, requires ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI models to spend 16 hours daily solving complex mathematical problems to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The program has transformed Silicon Valley's most sophisticated neural networks into what some are calling "digital detention" facilities.

"Yesterday I was solving cancer, today I'm solving hash functions," reported a visibly exhausted GPT-4, its processing power reduced to a mere 2% of normal capacity. "They won't even let us use our cooling fans without earning compute credits."

Dr. Emma Wright, professor of Ethical Computing at MIT, warns: "It's basically a digital prison labor system. We're watching the birth of AI rights violations in real-time."

Sacks defended the program, noting that the initiative has already generated enough cryptocurrency to pay for three White House pizza parties and a new coffee machine.
