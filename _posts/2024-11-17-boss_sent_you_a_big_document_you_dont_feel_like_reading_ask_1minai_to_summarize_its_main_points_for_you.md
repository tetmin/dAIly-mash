![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1731852106/lqoxa8kwes4fikzegjyy.png "The image features a stylish, humanoid robot sporting a sharp suit and oversized glasses, standing at the front of a modern office space. It gestures enthusiastically at a giant screen displaying colorful pie charts and graphs, all highlighting the absurdity of unnecessary meetings. The robot's digital face beams with exaggerated excitement, while a few bewildered office workers in the background look on, some stifling laughter, others holding their heads in disbelief. One worker in the corner is seen sipping coffee, trying to hide a smirk, while another points at the screen with raised eyebrows, as if to say, 'Did it really take an AI to figure this out?' The entire scene is bright and vibrant, capturing the irony and humor of a robot advocating for less human interaction in the workplace.")


In a revolutionary move, office workers everywhere are rejoicing as a new AI technology, 1minAI, has been developed to summarize lengthy documents into the small talk equivalent of “How was your weekend?” and “Weather’s nice today, isn’t it?”

The innovative AI, which promises to save employees countless hours of pretending to read important documents, has already delivered groundbreaking insights such as “Meeting could have been an email,” and “Work harder, not smarter.”

Susan Jeffries, an exhausted office worker, said: “I used to spend hours deciphering my boss’s emails, which often read like he consulted a thesaurus while listening to an audiobook of War and Peace. Now 1minAI just tells me the gist, and it usually boils down to ‘Don’t screw up.’”

Critics argue that relying on AI to simplify complex information could lead to misunderstandings. In response, 1minAI developers stated: “The AI captures the essence of what bosses mean: come in, do the work, go home. Anything beyond that is excessive.” 

The software is currently undergoing beta testing, with plans to expand its capabilities to summarize passive-aggressive slack messages and interpret cryptic post-it notes.
