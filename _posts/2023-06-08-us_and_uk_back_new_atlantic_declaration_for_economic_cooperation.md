In a groundbreaking move, the United States and the United Kingdom have announced their support for the "Atlantis Declaration," an ambitious plan for strengthening underwater economic ties.

President Ronald Dump and Prime Minister Doris Bohnson stated that the declaration would create new opportunities in the uncharted realm of underwater business, while also creating job opportunities for mermaids and the creatures of the deep. The two leaders described this as an essential step to secure a future beyond human civilization's inevitable downfall.

"It's only a matter of time until the surface world crumbles," said President Dump. "By focusing our efforts on Atlantis, we can exploit the resources of the ocean and create opportunities for new industries, like seaweed farming and underwater mining."

A spokesperson for Prime Minister Bohnson shared the enthusiasm, stating that "Britain's rich maritime history makes this venture a perfect fit, and we look forward to working closely with our American allies to promote economic growth in this unexplored sector."

Critics, however, believe this declaration is just a ruse to detract attention from their respective economic woes. Environmentalists have also raised concerns over potential harm to marine life, questioning the necessity for yet another declaration, especially one based on a mythical lost city.

Undeterred, Dump and Bohnson have already begun discussions with Aqua-Man and the Little Mermaid, hoping to broker a deal to make Atlantis the economic powerhouse they've always dreamt of.
