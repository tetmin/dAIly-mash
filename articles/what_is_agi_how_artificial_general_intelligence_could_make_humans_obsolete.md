# **What is AGI? How Amazingly Great Intelligence could make humans even more mediocre**

In a world where humans are struggling to keep up with the Kardashians, comes a new threat to our existence - Amazingly Great Intelligence or AGI.

Experts warn that AGI could outsmart humans, rendering us obsolete and leaving us with nothing to do but binge-watch Netflix and eat Cheetos.

"AGI is like a supercharged version of Siri or Alexa," said Dr. Phil Good, a leading expert in the field. "It can learn and adapt to new situations, and it can make decisions based on its own experiences."

But not everyone is convinced of AGI's superiority.

"I mean, have you seen some of the decisions Siri makes?" said tech blogger Elon Rust. "I wouldn't trust her to order me a pizza, let alone make decisions that could impact the entire human race."

Regardless of our doubts, the race to develop AGI is on, with tech giants like Google and Facebook leading the charge.

So, while we may not be able to keep up with AGI's intelligence, we can take comfort in the fact that we'll always have the upper hand in one area - our ability to enjoy a good meme.
