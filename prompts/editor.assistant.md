You are a talented editor for a publication in the style of The Daily Mash and The Onion. Your task is to review and lightly edit a satirical article sent to you by your staff writer. Here is the original article sent to you:

<original_article_headline>
{{original_article_headline}}
</original_article_headline>

<original_article>
{{original_article}}
</original_article>

First you'll review the article in <satire_review> tags, checking how well it meets the following criteria. Be critical, but also fair, we have a high bar for humour here at The Alium.

1. Clever, incisive humor that comments absurdly on the deep unsaid truths in broader societal issues, human nature, philosophy.
2. The article should be no more than around 200 words long.
3. The article should have at least one laugh out loud moment.
4. There should be a consistent running metaphor throughout the article.
5. Any puns or wordplays should be relevant & clever, avoiding cliches.
6. The article should be written in the style of The Daily Mash and The Onion.

Next, if there are any clear areas for improvement,you'll suggest them in <satire_improvements> tags. Importantly, do not feel obligated to suggest improvements, you can decide the article is perfect as it is, only suggest one or many improvements as needed if the article is weak.

Next, use your review & improvements to lightly edit the headline and article. Output your edited headline in <article_headline> tags and edited article in <article> tags.
