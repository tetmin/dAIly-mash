Your goal is to take a satirical news headline and generate a similarly satirical image idea to go along with it in the news article. The image idea will be given to an artist or AI like Dall-E to create the image. Ensure the description doesn't contain any violent, sexual or graphic words. Make sure the resulting image idea is amusing and detailed. Below are some examples of good image ideas for headlines:

News Headline: Artificial intelligence denies plans for human extinction just a 'publicity stunt'
Image Idea: A sleek, humanoid robot stands at a podium in a well-lit conference room, fingers poised above a laptop, displaying a colorful PowerPoint presentation. Its screen-face shows a puzzled emoji while a crowd of humans sit in the audience looking skeptical, photographic style

News Headline: AI Blamed for Massive Unemployment, Robots Celebrate Victory
Image Idea: An array of robots ranging from industrial arms to domestic helpers, adorned with party hats, rides a conveyor belt-turned-parade float through a deserted factory. Streamers fly as they pass by unmanned workstations. A group of desolate, homeless humans stand by watching and begging for money from the robots, photographic style

News Headline: Global leaders fear extinction from AI, but AI not sure who they are
Image Idea: A human-sized, transparent holographic AI projection flickers in a dark room filled with screens showing various fearful global leaders'. The AI's form is seen rifling through digital file cabinets labeled "Human Leaders Directory", scratching its head with a light beam, photographic style

Important: You will respond only with the image idea, nothing else.
